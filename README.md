### Work Experience 
**August 2021 to December 2021** - My first major project was designing and creating [this website](https://highitsky.com/). This website is solely HTML + CSS, entirely created by me. My greatest challenge with this project was making the navigation bar stick to the top of the screen upon scroll. Overall, this project took over 100 hours to complete. I continue to maintain this website today.

**January 2022 to May 2022** - This was when I was first introduced to Java and where I partook in 11 projects over the semester. I was not allowed to utilize most of the Java packages in many of these projects, which made it challenging to recreate some of the methods required to complete the project. Some of the major projects were a [working bank account](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI231-Project-11), a [temperature converter](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI231-Project-9/tree/main) that also compared temperatures, a decimal number that's binary value helped determine each field in a two-dimensional array to be either ["Heads" or "Tails"](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI231-Project-8/tree/main), as well as an [amortization schedule](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI231-Project-5/tree/main). 

**August 2022 to December 2022** - I was introduced to Javascript and was assigned to create a program that [displayed blog posts and comments](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/INF651FinalProject) for particular users. I also created a C++ [binary calculator](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI321-Project-1/tree/main), an ASM [hexadecimal calculator](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI321-Project-5/tree/main), an ASM [GCD calculator](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI321-Project-8/tree/main), a Java [Palindrome checker](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI251-Heiland-ProjectTwo), a Java [hashtable](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI251ProjectThree-Heiland/tree/main), and a Java Matrix that represented a [weighted directed graph](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI251-Heiland-ProjectFive/tree/main). I also began learning how to create graphics such as a [spinning triangle](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI431-Project-3) and a [rotating pyramid](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI431-Project-8).

**January 2023 to May 2023** - I participated in a semester-long project where we created a [car transportation app](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI441-GroupProject). While this took up a majority of my time, I also began learning SML, where I created a project that [converted ASCII](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI421-Project-3/tree/main). I created a SWI-Prolog project that solved the [wolf, goat, cabbage riddle](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI421-Project-5), as well as a PHP project that would [create, remove, edit, and output various quotes](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/Heiland_INF653_Midterm/tree/main) pulled from a database, and a Node.JS project that would [display various State funfacts](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/INF653_Final_Project/tree/main). 

**August 2023 to December 2023** - In my final semester, I took up an internship where I was a Web and Media Developer at US Quadball. I was tasked to redesign US Quadball's main and member websites. I audited both websites, heuristically evaluating each one, and independently conducted usability tests, with scenarios, moderator scripts, pre and post-test questionnaires, and 20 tasks for three testers to do. Using my findings and approved by my supervisor, I made all the changes. As for school projects, I created a [Process Control Block](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI331-Project-1/tree/main) with and without LinkedList, as well as a program that utilized how a [Buffer](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI331-Project-2/tree/main) worked with and without semaphores.
