### Work Experience 
**August 2021 to December 2021** - My first major project was designing and creating [this website](https://highitsky.com/). This website is solely HTML + CSS, entirely created by me. My greatest challenge with this project was making the navigation bar stick to the top of the screen upon scroll. Overall, this project took over 100 hours to complete. I continue to maintain this website today.

**January 2022 to May 2022** - This was when I was first introduced to Java and where I partook in 11 projects over the semester. I was not allowed to utilize most of the Java packages in many of these projects, which made it challenging to recreate some of the methods required to complete the project. Some of the major projects were a [working bank account](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI231-Project-11), a [temperature converter](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI231-Project-9/tree/main) that also compared temperatures, a decimal to binary number [project](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI231-Project-8/tree/main) that helped fill a two-dimensional array with Heads or Tails, as well as an [amortization schedule](https://github.com/Kylie-Heiland/CSCI231-Project-5/tree/main).
